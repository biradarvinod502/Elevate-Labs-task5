# Elevate-Labs-task5

Objective:
Capture live network packets, analyze them, and identify common protocols.

Steps Performed:
Wireshark was launched on Kali Linux and a live capture was started on the active interface. Traffic was generated by browsing websites, including instagram.com, and running ping google.com. After about one minute the capture was stopped and saved in .pcap format. Filters like DNS, TCP, ICMP, and HTTPS were applied to focus on key packets.

Findings:
The capture showed DNS queries resolving google.com and instagram.com, TCP communication for web traffic, ICMP packets from the ping command, and encrypted HTTPS packets when visiting Instagram.

Key Learnings:
This task helped me practice packet capture, filtering, and protocol analysis, and showed how HTTPS traffic remains encrypted while still revealing connection details.

Deliverables:
Packet capture file (.pcap) and this brief report.
